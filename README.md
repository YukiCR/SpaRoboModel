# SpaRoboModel

this repo is created for dynamic modelling of space robot,yet is toooo naiiive, if you are intrested in modelling of space robot, DO SEE https://github.com/NPS-SRL/SPART , a brilliant repo on modelling with NOC.

we are now temporarily stop modelling with Python, all MATLAB tests are based on SPART now.

**Acknowledgement**
+ this toy repo is based on SPART, we would greatly appreciate this work
+ I personally thank to Renhao Mao's help with implementation of Runge-Kutta method of system dynamics and debugging.
